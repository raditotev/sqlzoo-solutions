-- 1. The first example shows the goal scored by 'Lord Bendtner'. Show matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. teamid = 'GER'

SELECT matchid, player FROM goal
WHERE teamid = 'GER';

-- 2. From the previous query you can see that Lars Bender's goal was scored in game 1012. Notice that the column matchid in the goal table corresponds to the id column in the game table.

SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2
  FROM game
 WHERE id=1012;

-- 3. You can combine the two steps into a single query with a JOIN. You will get all the game details and all the goal details if you use

SELECT player,teamid, mdate
FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
WHERE teamid='GER';

-- 4. Use the same JOIN as in the previous question.
-- Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%' Frag einfach die Lehrerin nach der LÃ¶sung ;)

SELECT team1,team2, player
FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
WHERE player LIKE 'Mario%';

-- 5. The table eteam gives details of every national team including the coach. You can JOIN goal to eteam using the phrase goal JOIN eteam on teamid=id
-- Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10

SELECT player, teamid, coach, gtime
FROM goal JOIN eteam ON (teamid=id)
WHERE gtime<=10

-- 6. To JOIN game with eteam you could use either
-- game JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id) or game JOIN eteam ON (team2=eteam.id)
-- Notice that because id is a column name in both game and eteam you must specify eteam.id instead of just id
-- List the the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.

SELECT mdate, teamname
FROM game JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id)
WHERE coach='Fernando Santos';

-- 7. List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

SELECT player
FROM goal JOIN game ON (matchid=id)
WHERE stadium='National Stadium, Warsaw'

-- 8. The example query shows all goals scored in the Germany-Greece quarterfinal.
-- Instead show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany.

SELECT DISTINCT player
FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
WHERE (team1 ='GER' OR team2='GER') AND teamid!='GER';

-- 9. Show teamname and the total number of goals scored.

SELECT teamname, COUNT(gtime)
FROM eteam JOIN goal ON id=teamid
GROUP BY teamname;

-- 10. Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.

SELECT stadium, COUNT(gtime)
FROM game JOIN goal ON id=matchid
GROUP BY stadium;

-- 11. For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.

SELECT matchid,mdate, COUNT(gtime)
FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
WHERE (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL')
GROUP BY matchid;

-- 12. For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'

SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(gtime)
FROM goal JOIN game ON matchid=id
WHERE (team1='GER' OR team2='GER') AND teamid='GER'
GROUP BY matchid;

-- 13. List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.

SELECT DISTINCT mdate, team1,
    SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1,
    team2,
    SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score2
  FROM game LEFT JOIN goal ON game.id = matchid
  GROUP BY id
  ORDER BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2;
